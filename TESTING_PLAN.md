# Testing Plan and Guidelines

## Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ - Completed
- üöß - In Progress
- ‚è≥ - Pending
- ‚úîÔ∏è - Verified

## General Instructions and Principles
- All code comments in English
- Team communication in Russian
- Follow SOLID, DRY and KISS principles
- Use TypeScript
- Use ESLint
- NEVER ignore TypeScript or ESLint errors

## Test Environment
- Production Supabase: iabwkgppahudnaouwaep
- Test Supabase: vupwomxxfqjmwtbptkfu
- Test database is a full copy of production
- Sync from PROD to TEST available via `npm run sync:prod:test`

## Safety Rules
- Integration tests MUST run ONLY on Test Supabase
- NEVER run integration tests against Production
- Always verify Supabase project reference before test execution
- Test environment variables are stored in .env.test

## Project Structure
- Unit tests: Located in `__tests__` folder next to each component
- Integration tests: Located in `src/__tests__/integration`
- E2E tests: Located in `src/__tests__/e2e`

## Current Status

### Unit Tests
- ‚úÖ Components tests
- ‚úÖ Hooks tests
- ‚úÖ API mocks

### Integration Environment
- ‚úÖ Test Supabase project setup
- ‚úÖ Sync script from PROD to TEST
- ‚úÖ Test database configuration

## Integration Tests Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication and RLS
- üöß Basic authentication tests (starting with minimal smoke test)
- ‚è≥ RLS policy verification
- ‚è≥ User roles and permissions

### Phase 2: CRUD Operations
- ‚è≥ Create operations tests
- ‚è≥ Read operations tests
- ‚è≥ Update operations tests
- ‚è≥ Delete operations tests
- ‚è≥ Data validation tests

### Phase 3: Storage Operations
- ‚è≥ File upload tests
- ‚è≥ File retrieval tests
- ‚è≥ File deletion tests
- ‚è≥ Storage permissions tests

### Phase 4: Push Notifications
- ‚è≥ Notification sending tests
- ‚è≥ Notification receiving tests
- ‚è≥ Notification handling tests

### Test Infrastructure
- ‚è≥ Database cleanup script
- ‚è≥ Test data generation
- ‚è≥ CI/CD for integration tests

### Documentation
- ‚è≥ Testing process description
- ‚è≥ Test environment setup guide
- ‚è≥ Integration tests examples

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Notes
- All tests should use real test database (copy of production)
- No mocking for Supabase operations
- Clear test data before and after test runs
